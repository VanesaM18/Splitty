- Our shared team values
   - *Be nice:*
First of all, we want to be nice to each other, being mean is counterproductive and doesn't solve anything. It's also not very good for team morale. When we disagree with, or have critique for a teammate we kindly express our opinion or give constructive criticism.

   - *Respond on time:*
Secondly, we value responding in a timely manner. This does not mean that we always need to respond within an hour, but leaving your teammates on read for a day can be very annoying. It can also lead to missing deadlines, or being unable to contribute enough as a team member.

   - *Help a teammate when they get stuck:*
Thirdly, we help a teammate when they get stuck. We are all in this together, and when someone gets stuck, they can slow the whole team down. By helping each other, we ensure that we can always be on time for ourj deadlines. Also, leaving a teammate to their own devices when they can't figure something out, or if they have personal issues is not nice.

   - *Clear communication:*
Communication is key, and if someone doesn't understand the full picture that can lead to problems. We want to make sure that everybody is on the same page. This means that everyone knows what their tasks are before the next meeting, that everyone knows when the next deadlines are, etc.

   - *Transparency*
We value transparency, because, as stated previously, we want everybody to be on the same page. Whether we are having personal problems or have critique, we should not be afraid to tell our teammates. This means making sure that we are open to critique and trying to understand each other before jumping to conclusions.

- Assignment description
    - In this project, our team will actively enhance and apply object-oriented programming skills to develop a client-server prototype application. The primary objective will be to create a scalable application as a base platform that allows the required technologies to be further implemented. The importance of addressing it as a foundational platform should enable us to construct on the basic requirements by utilising based design patterns, resulting in an application that can be further extended and improved.
	- Nonetheless, the project places a strong emphasis on developing effective teamwork, promoting an environment of open communication where each of us can evolve within our framework, where our diverse perspectives can contribute to the growth of the project and of each other's abilities.
	- Beyond the technical aspects, the team will aspire to not only meet the target points of the functional and non-functional requirements of the final application, but to make of this experience an opportunity to learn in the scope of our future personal and professional career.

- Target or ambition level
   - Our target grade for this project is 7.75, which we collectively agreed upon after considering each member's desired grade. Recognizing that some of us aim to pass while others aspire for a perfect score of 10, we found 7.75 to be a reasonable compromise that aligns with our collective goals. This target grade corresponds to a 'Good' assessment rating for most of the evaluation criteria.
   - Our goal, however, is not only to meet the criteria for a 'Good' assessment but also to maximize the project's  and ours potentials. We believe that focusing on the essentials will lay a solid foundation for success. However, we also acknowledge the potential for improvement and enhancement. Therefore, if time permits, we plan to incorporate additional features and optimizations to elevate our project to a higher level. By aiming for an 'Excellent' assessment rating across multiple components and adding supplementary features, we aim to exceed our initial target and potentially achieve a grade of 9 or higher, provided that our efforts proceed smoothly and effectively.
- Planning
   - *Goals:*
The goals of these agreements are to ensure that we can (1) meet all deadlines while (2) maintaining high-quality work, that we can (3) work in a minimal-stress environment, and that we (4) maintain clear communication.
   - *Agreements:*
1. Setting deadlines:
    - Agreement: Internal deadlines will be planned, which are ahead of the official deadlines.
    - Explanation: By setting earlier internal deadlines, we allow for time for reviews, (possible) required changes and unexpected issues.
    - Justification: Planning early will ensure high-quality work and reduce last-minute stress.
2. Proactive communication:
    - Agreement: If a team member believes they might be unable to make their deadline, they must inform the team of this as quickly as possible.
    - Explanation: Good communication will allow the rest of the team to offer assistance and allows the team to think of a solution together.
    - Justification: Early communication allows for swift handling of the situation, and helps maintain the trust within the team.
3. Submissions/hand-ins:
    - Agreement: The chair of the week will hand in all required documents.
    - Explanation: Having a known person that submits the week's work removes the need to discuss who will hand something in.
    - Justification: Having a single person responsible for the submissions avoids confusion, streamlines the process, and minimizes errors.

    - *Additional considerations:*
      1. Realistic deadlines:
          - Setting overly ambitious deadlines can be an easy trap to fall into due to the difficulty of estimation of the required time for a task. Overly ambitious deadlines are likely to lead to the exact problems that the early deadlines are supposed to prevent, putting us back to square 1.
          - As such, we will make sure not to be too ambitious in our planning, and strike a balance between efficiency and feasibility.
      2. Flexibility:
          - Although we need to make sure that all deadlines are met, we must also accept the possibility of unexpected circumstances or problems coming to light. In these situations, we will be understanding and try to resolve the situation together with the entire team.
- Communication
    - Our main communication channel is a group chat on Whatsapp. Here, we discuss most of our topics like deadlines, upcoming events, team meetings and any other relevant business. This allows us to communicate quickly and get timely responses. For video communication, we will use Discord. However, we prefer meeting in person if possible.

    - We will comment and/or give feedback on merge requests or issues on Gitlab, anything related to the code itself should be discussed on Gitlab, so that we can easily propose changes and that way the TAs can also easily check our progress.

    - We will communicate with our TA on Mattermost, which will include sending a message when the next agenda has been uploaded, or when the meeting notes have been uploaded. Also, if we have any questions for him, we will ask them there, or during one of the weekly TA meetings.


- Commitment

    - *Quality and Dedication in Our Team:*
Our team's fundamental values are dedication and quality. Each participant contributes their special talents to produce something very remarkable. This is about building something that we can all be proud of, where every line of code and every choice matters, not simply checking boxes.
    - *Code Reviews: A Key Practice -*
Each and every piece of code undergoes a rigorous review procedure to guarantee quality standards. Before submitting their work to the project, two members always review each other's work. By allowing us to learn from one another, this strategy not only helps us sustain high-quality production but also promotes personal growth. At least two merge requests should be considered by the whole team each week, and everyone should provide feedback on any changes that may be made.
    - *Clean Code Practices:*
Properly described codes are essential elements that aid in understanding even when new members are added later. We closely follow CheckStyle & JavaDoc, which keeps everything in order.
We also emphasize the use of useful and unambiguous variable names. We designate variables with names that make it clear what they are used for, as opposed to short, unclear names like "a." This little change has a significant impact on how legible and manageable our code is.
    - *Testing:*
We think that testing helps to keep software products error-free during development. We recommend writing some tests within the same week as the code. Although we do anticipate testing to be a part of the process, this does not mean that we have specific guidelines on how much to test at this point. It's acceptable to add tests a little later on occasion, but writing tests on a weekly basis is what matters most. Regular testing increases productivity since it expedites the resolution of process problems.  
    - *Giving And Receiving Constructive Feedback:*
We need feedback, especially the people who take minutes and serve as chairs. We think it's important to provide constructive criticism so that we can all get better. This is about addressing what could be improved and praising what is working, not about blaming someone.
    - *Overall:*
Our commitment to great work and one another is what sets us apart. In addition to software, regular testing, clear standards, open communication, and constructive criticism all aid in the development of a strong, supportive, and excellence-focused team. This work ethic is not just a rule; it's a promise we make to each other and to the project we are enthusiastic about.

- Behaviour
  - As a team we have agreed on treating each other fairly and equally. Everyone should portray a somewhat positive attitude towards the team and a good work ethic. A good work ethic is defined as completing your work on time, showing up to meetings on time, helping others who seem to be struggling with their part of the project and contributing to the group in ways such as but not limited to: actively responding to messages, giving meaningful feedback to other team members and coming up with ideas for the main purpose of this project. A good work ethic will in turn lead to a more suitable environment in which inventive ideas will prosper. This will also help the team feel more at ease with bringing up issues or problems they encounter in the project or group itself.

  - When a member acts out of line of the above mentioned agreements, depending on how severe their actions are, a consequence with similar severity will be met.
  - In case of tardiness without valid reasoning, a conversation between the member in offence will be held. If a member is only late once, a warning will be given. If this behaviour is repeatedly continued, then an external party will be asked to give their perspective on the matter.
  - If a member has poor attitude towards the rest of the group, similar to a member being tardy a discussion with said member will take place. If this attitude is not corrected in sufficient time and with enough effort, a TA will be informed of this member's behaviour and other steps in compliance with the seriousness of the situation will be enforced.

  - In case of any disagreements about the project in the group, each member in the group should try and explain their standpoint and why they believe it to be correct. The team should try to come to a unanimous decision and if not a vote will be taken, if the voting outcome is equal the designated chairs vote will count double. In the event that the team still seems to be dissatisfied a TA will be invoked to further help to decide if the decision is smart or not and serve as a third unbiased party in the disagreement.

- Decision-making
    - The team underscores the significance of collaborative leadership and inclusive participation by emphasising team voting and chair decisions as the primary means of resolving conflicts.
	- Prioritising fairness and equality, each member has an equal and influential role in the decision-making process. This commitment ensures an environment where diverse perspectives are valued and contribute to a positive team dynamic. The team chair acts as a neutral arbiter to ensure a fair resolution and to make sure that the decision activities remain objective.
	- Additionally, the chair serves as the final decision making authority, aiming to prioritise the project progress. As the last resort, the involvement of the Teaching Assistant will be purely in the scope of guidance, such that the team fosters addressing and resolving issues independently.
	- Decisions are promptly made to avoid unnecessary delays, this way the team stays on track and achieves its objectives within set timelines. Moreover, encouraging open dialogue allows each team member to express concerns and collaboratively reach compromises.
	- Lastly, the team will make sure that the collaborative dynamic will be optimised over time by periodically reviewing the past decision making processes. 


- Dealing with consequences
  - Similar to what was said prior in the behaviour section about disagreements, for conflicts in the group similar actions will be taken. Considering the fact that a conflict can be more than just a disagreement, we will elaborate on different types of conflicts and how the team as a whole should deal with them.
  - Under conflicts we understand project-based disagreements and actual tensions between members of the group, in case of disagreements the protocol explained in the behaviour section will be used as a guide to solve them. On the other hand if the conflict is deemed to be more of a type of tension between members of the team a different protocol will be taken:
  - If two members in the team seem to have some sort of tension between them, they should try to solve this issue between themselves. This can be done by for example planning a separate meeting, where they can both work out their differences and similar to a disagreement explain why they feel the way they feel, to procent the situation from escalating. If this still doesn’t work the two members can consult with the rest of the group what exactly is going on.
  - If all members in the team feel as if one member is not contributing as much to the assignment a conversation with the member in question should be held. If the member still seems to be unproductive and does not contribute to the project, a TA will be informed of the members behaviour.

- Outside collaboration
  - Our mandatory session is every Tuesday during weeks 1-4 and 6-9 from 14:45 to 15:30 and we decided that we will be meeting every time after it to discuss the points of action in more depth. We are doing this because we believe that 45 minutes a week is definitely not enough time for us to go through each question that needs to be talked about. This outside meeting will be done in person in one of the TU Delft faculties and will last at least an hour. We will also try to book a project room in the library for this time slot if this is possible, since it is pretty hard to find a comfortable study place otherwise.
  - We also think that we will need even more meetings when the workload increases. When that happens we will organize additional meetings which could be done either in person or online. We will decide on the details depending on our schedules and will try our best to respect everyone’s wishes. If that is not possible we will be using a majority vote to decide on a time.
