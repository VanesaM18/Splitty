# Minutes meeting 1
- Environment check:
   - Everyone set-up environment
- Code of conduct draft:
  - Looks good for a draft we still just need to divide the tasks and add some bonus points - (will be done after meeting?)
  - Write things out to make things clear
  - Final code of conduct should be done before the next meeting
- Agenda template outdated - next week use agenda from brightspace, remove “template from agenda for next weeks”
- Task priorities
  - Voting for priorities in backlog
  - Testing
    - When we add tests:
      - Add tests within the same week, write tests to make sure that the feature actually works in case something goes wrong of in case of regressions (not 100% coverage at first)
      - At the end of the project we can add more tests (this can also be used as an opportunity for people who haven’t contributed as much to the project)
    - Both unit tests and manual testing as well
- Template project - see if it runs on everyone's laptop by next week
- Knock out criteria:
  - In study guide
  - Starting this week, by sunday everyone should have written at least 100 lines, 3 commits, created a merge requests, approved merge-request that is not your own and added at least one comment on someone else's merge request (first week just code something related to the app, doesn’t have to be perfect)
  - Code we write in the first week will probably be completely different in the last week (if that happens it’s completely fine)
  - Good to already work on project before lecture, might make lecture easier
- Working with git in project, work with main everytime feature is done we add it to the main
- Tool to check amount of lines written - toke
- Questions:
  - How much should we know about the code: everyone should be able to participate about how it works on a certain level, everyone should be up to date, but there won’t be extremely specific questions about how everything works. Everyone should be able to join in the conversation and talk about the project.
