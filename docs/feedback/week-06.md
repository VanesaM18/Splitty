#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Strong lead in the meeting. Made sure the agenda was covered and kept everything going with leaving space for everyone to add input. Keep a bit more track of time. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Team had good ownership about the meeting. Everyone threw their ideas and participated in the meeting. Noah you were too silent in the meeting. Recent conflicts have not been nice but don't let yourself down because you have to keep participating to make things better eventhough this might not be nice now.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: App looks really good and complete. Looks like the features implemented are going over the minimum requirement which is nice. Progress was very solid for the last two weeks. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Seems like everyone does around the same amount of time but assign goals to people and track their progress to really hold people accountable. This can be done in the agenda. Noah you seem to have less contribution in the team right now. Being able to do less in the same time is fine but you should still be able to have a rough idea about all parts of the application and be able to participate in discussion.
