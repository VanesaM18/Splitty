# Get to know each other

## Goal 

• Introduce yourself (coding experience, interests, hobbies)
• Look into the template for the code of conduct, discuss the various points. (Website » Assignments » Teamwork » Code of Conduct)
• Make yourself familiar with the lecture schedule. Discuss assignment deadlines and talk about your planning.
• Discuss the project topic. Which features do you remember? Which ones do you find interesting? Which ones did you not understand?
• Remember: You are in charge, the TA is the “fly on the wall”

## Formative Assessment

During the meetings, I will each week fill in some rubric items. All items are supposed to be assessed on a scale from Insufficient, Sufficient, Good, Excellent.
Yes, the rubric in this first week is rather trivial.


#### 1) Self-organization

Of course the meeting was not yet self-organised but this will hopefully be the case from next week on! Overall feeling was very good. You were open and talked freely about strong points and short comings of each person. Keep on going like this!


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Are all topics that are important during the meeting covered or do you miss some? Luckily because I was in charge of the meeting all important point were covered ;)
