# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Ruben
Minute: Noah

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Very solid chair and minute taker. Keep this up each week and you are fine for this component! Make sure the minute taker also puts in the notes taken on Gitlab as well!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was the main improvement point from this meeting. It was not very clear and should be spend more time on to structure the meeting beter. Overall it was oké. The beter it is the beter I can prepare. As told also use the BS template although it is no problem for this week. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You started out a bit awkwardly but got the hang of it when the real discussion started. You were in control but were not taking over the whole meeting. Your online tool was super cool, it did not work out which made you a bit stressed. No worries, you are the meeting leader by that everything you do is the right thing. As long as you believe that the audience will believe it too. Suddenly there was a back up other online tool. This shows you were amazingly well prepared. Very well done!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You were leading the meeting so that was very good. Athmosphere was very constructive and everyone was heared. Matei was a bit offline because he was online (pun intended). It was oké but if anyone is online in another meeting try to be more active. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: It seems like you were all on the same line so that was good. The other meeting without me really helped for this. 

#### Overall

Very solid meeting. Some improvement points but for sure on the good way!
