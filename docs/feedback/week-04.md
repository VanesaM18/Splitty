# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Andreea
Minute: Ruben

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Really good attempt to make an extensive agenda. This is what you should go for. The points however are not as important. For example having main point Announcements by the team and sub point Allow for any announcements to be made it is kind of duplicate. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Short .md bullets with the most important things so that is very good. I do feel you still miss some small important things in them but overall very good


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You went over the topics but didn't really lead. If silences occur you should be the one who leads to meeting to something else to be discussed. This could be done more by you. You were leading in the beginning but Matei took a bit over on the end and this is not on Matei. There just came too less input from you. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The meeting started and ended out pretty awkward again. Really try to become a bit closer with eachother. These meetings don't need to be staged but can be friendly meetups. There was no healthy atmosphere for a discussion. There were many slicences. Matei felt like the only person who was trying to keep the meeting going, the rest should have way more input. The things needed to be discussed were discussed but that is it. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The products is on track but not by much. Improvements should increase over the weeks to really get evertything done. Try to do more features per week and do a bit more styling to your app (it is easier to do allong the way).


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient/Very Good

Feedback: From the meeting I feel it is a very good distribution in the team but when I look at the git analytics of week 2 and 3 I need to note that Noah did not do that much. If there are problems please raise them. If there are no problems then there is no problem.
