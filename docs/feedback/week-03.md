# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Nathan
Minute: Matei

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Meeting organization was organized enough. Could be beter prepared to fill the time more but overall oke. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was not much filled in. Take more time to write out what things you want to discuss. This will help a lot in the meeting. You need to follow the template (as you do) but you can make some changes as well and add some stuff if you want to. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Some small things could be written out a bit more but overall it is very well done!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: Nathan you mostly were in charge of the meeting but I felt Vanessa sometimes needed to steer the meeting a tiny bit towards the right direction. Agenda was covered and important things were mentioned. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Sometimes there were some unpleasant silences. I think a better preparation about possible discussion points would be good for this. Everyone was nice though and was active in discusssions. Matei and Noah you should be contributing a bit more. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient

Feedback: You did not present anything out of yourself. Try to do this for the next meetings alway, preferably something visual. The thing you showed was oke for the first week of coding but next week there should be more to see.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: It does not really seem that there is an unfair work contribution. A tip is to note down the todo's per person per week somewhere so someone can easily can be held accountable if they to not meet their deadlines. It seems Vanessa has a bit more overview of everything but all within the reasonable bounds for the rest.
